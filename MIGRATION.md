# Migrating from Prewalk 0.3.1 to 0.4.0

Prewalk 0.4.0 replaces the simulated model-switch workflow with host-native
executor orchestration. Upgrade the plugin, restart the host, and begin a new
Prewalk run. Do not reuse an in-flight 0.3.1 handoff.

## Upgrade

Codex:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace upgrade prewalk-marketplace
codex plugin add prewalk@prewalk-marketplace
```

Claude Code:

```sh
claude plugin marketplace update prewalk
claude plugin update prewalk@prewalk
```

Use only the namespaced skills shown in the main README. The active root
session remains the planner for the entire planning phase; Prewalk does not
select, replace, or restore its model.

## Presets

Remove `planner` and `planner_thinking` from custom preset files. They are
accepted temporarily so `pw-doctor` can report a deprecation warning, but they
are ignored. Keep `executor`, `max_todos`, `handoff_mode`, and
`require_model_routing`.

Rename `executor_thinking` to `executor_effort`. Codex requests it only when the
live native `spawn_agent` schema exposes `reasoning_effort`. Claude Code does
not currently expose a supported per-subagent effort control, so Prewalk reports
the configured request as unsupported instead of claiming it was applied.

## Checkpoints and todos

Remove the synthetic `PAUSE` checkpoint todo from custom instructions. A v4
todo snapshot contains real work only. The planner completes and verifies task 1,
then its root `Stop` event persists the exact structured handoff packet. Zero or
one remaining real task stays in the root session; two or more may be routed to
one executor after review or through `--fast`.

## State reset

The v4 durable state schema is intentionally incompatible with v3. On first
load, a v3 record for the current session is reset and Prewalk asks for a new
run; records belonging to other sessions are left untouched. The reset prevents
an old ambiguous handoff from being mistaken for a live native executor.

After upgrading, run the host-specific doctor before arming:

```text
$prewalk:pw-doctor
/prewalk:pw-doctor
```

If a v4 route later becomes `incomplete`, use the namespaced retry command. If
it becomes `stale`, first prove the recorded agent is no longer running, then
use the namespaced reconcile command. Disarming clears Prewalk state only; it
does not stop an executor.
