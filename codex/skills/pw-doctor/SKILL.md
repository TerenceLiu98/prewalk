# Prewalk Doctor

Inspect the live `spawn_agent` schema, then pass exactly the fields it exposes:

```bash
python3 hooks/_arm.py doctor "${CODEX_THREAD_ID:-${CODEX_SESSION_ID:-}}" \
  --schema-fields=task_name,message,fork_turns,model,reasoning_effort
```

Omit absent fields and do not call the tool. A missing model argument means
spawn handoff cannot honor presets with
`require_model_routing=true`; recommend the manual model + `pw-resume` fallback.
Also report a missing or mismatched `CODEX_THREAD_ID`. Native session binding
requires Codex CLI 0.146.0 or newer; after upgrading, restart the Codex thread.
